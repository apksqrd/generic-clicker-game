# Generic Clicker Game

A generic clicker web game made with rust.

I keep thinking of gameplay that I want to include, but I am going to keep this project true to the spirit of generic clicker games.

## TODO

- [x] Add incrementation (the main gameplay)
- [ ] Afk income
- [ ] Check if the game is thread safe
- [ ] Figure out what to do with max int limit
- [ ] Add settings page
- [x] Autosave
- [ ] Graphics (just images)
- [x] Upgrades
- [ ] Prevent people from manually changing localstorage
  - It is a singleplayer game so it doesn't matter, but still interesting
- [ ] Google analytics
  - I don't want to track users and sell their info to google or whatever, but it would be cool to see how many people visited.
